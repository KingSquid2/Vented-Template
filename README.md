# About
Vented is a simple proxy site with the main theme of the popular mafia-style game "Among Us." It features modern tools such as a stealth mode (hides your tab and history), NSFW Unblocker, working Among Us in the web browser, a working chatbox, and much more. It has a very sleek, fast, and even lightweight design made solely for server storage. It uses only the most advanced javascript to complete simple things such as surfing on a proxy. With it's iconic animated background, and very cringe name, Vented is for sure going to be your #1 proxy choice! With this template, you get alot less features. This isn't the full site, as I have stopped making my websites open-source after multiple stealing incidents.


# Deployment
You can easily, and seamlessly deploy your own copy with <strong>3 CLICKS!</strong> Just click a host to deploy to, and code away. You must provide credit, or else I can strike your website down.

<strong>(NOTE: All proxies are locally hosted besides PyDodge, so you must change that in the surf.js file, see more about this type of modification [here](https://github.com/vented-devs/Vented-Template/blob/main/LICENSE))</strong>
