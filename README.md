# About
AUP, better know as Among Us Proxies, is a simple proxy site with the main theme of the popular mafia-style game "Among Us." It features modern tools such as a stealth mode (hides your tab and history), NSFW Unblocker, working Among Us in the web browser, and much more. It has a very sleek, fast, and even lightweight design made solely for server storage. It uses only the most advanced javascript to complete simple things such as surfing on a proxy. With it's iconic animated background, and very cringe name, AUP is for sure going to be your #1 proxy choice!

# Roadmap
The thing about plans, is that all of them aren't possible. Sometimes you forget, or they're just impossible to pull off. One major thing I'd love to do is getting Node Unblocker with stealth mode. It's possible, and it's easy to do, but it'll add unwanted clutter to the files, and also make server space beefier.

What it's supposed to look like:

As you could see, Alloy has stealth and classic mode, but Node doesn't support stealth. Another thing I'd like to get out as fast as possible, is Aurora Proxy. It's an amazing proxy being developed by the team at Titanium Network! It's currently not ready for public release, but soon I'll be able to remove this error you get when trying to user/enter the selection screen for Aurora

# Deployment
Deploying your own copy has never been easier, and I've made it easier by adding repl.it integrations. No need to install anything, just deploy, hit start, and go! I've also attached a [video](#video), just incase you don't understand anything I just typed, or you're smol brain hehe
