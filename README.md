# About
Vented is a simple proxy site with the main theme of the popular mafia-style game "Among Us." It features modern tools such as a stealth mode (hides your tab and history), NSFW Unblocker, working Among Us in the web browser, a working chatbox, and much more. It has a very sleek, fast, and even lightweight design made solely for server storage. It uses only the most advanced javascript to complete simple things such as surfing on a proxy. With it's iconic animated background, and very cringe name, Vented is for sure going to be your #1 proxy choice! With this template, you get alot less features. This isn't the full site, as I have stopped making my websites open-source after multiple stealing incidents.


# Deployment
Deploying your own copy has never been easier, and I've made it alot easier by adding repl.it integrations. No need to install anything, just deploy, hit start, and go! It can't get any easier, as I have also attached a VIDEO for people who do not understand! You must give credit!

<strong>(NOTE: All proxies are locally hosted besides PyDodge, so you must change that in the surf.js file, see more about this type of modification [here](https://github.com/vented-devs/Vented-Template/blob/main/LICENSE))</strong>
